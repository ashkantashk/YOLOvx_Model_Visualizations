# Visualization of YOLOvx models

# Introduction
This repository contains code for illustrating YOLOvx models using a predefined visualization tool known as visualtorch.

<p align="justify">
The requirement for running this code is as follows:
  a. installing ultralytics, and visualtorch with all their dependencies and requirements using pip:
    pip install ultralytics
    pip install visualtorch
  b. By default, the above codes will ask for installing torch, torchvision and other dependencies. Otherwise, you should install them separately:
    pip install torch, torchvision
